### CPSC 120

lab #1 

Lab one was the first lab we ever did this presented a real challenge to me since i have never coded before this point. Walking into the classroom i didn't know what to expect the TA told us that we would be put into random partners and that added to the tension. AFter being assigned a partner both of us being confused got to work. Looking back the lab wasnt that hard we just had to print out "hello world" into the terminal but starting out it took us ages to complete and it gave me a taste of what the class would be about. 

lab #9 

In lab #9 we where tasked with creating a code that would spellcheck words. Using the new command line argument BOOL witch is used to clasify something as either true or not true and vectors (a list of things) to make a list of all words spelled in the dictionary and checking if they where the same as the word we gave it with the bool command we where able to spellcheck words. This presented a fun challenge for me because the new stuff we had to learn became more complicated then the stuff before it Vectors where hard to get the grasp of at first but then became eiser to write and use. 

Lab #3 

on lab three we had to make a code that measured a mans and a womas MBR this being one of the first labs we ever did was mostly an introduction to the std::cout and std::cin comands. Prompting users to intup data into the computer like height, weight, age, and sex. This served as a good introduction to the CIN and COUT commands and getting me more used to the basics of C++ programing.
